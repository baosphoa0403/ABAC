## ABAC Implementation
The Hospital Management System uses Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to ensure secure and granular access control to sensitive hospital data and resources. ABAC allows for the definition of access policies based on attributes, such as user roles, department, seniority, or other contextual information.

The ABAC implementation in the HMS includes the following components:
- Policy engine: Responsible for evaluating access requests against the defined policies
- Attribute management: Handles the storage and retrieval of user and resource attributes
- Policy administration: Allows administrators to define and manage access control policies
